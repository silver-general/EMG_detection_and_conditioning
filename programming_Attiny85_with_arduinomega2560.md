I have found a couple of ways to do that. Some are high level (meaning: you can see fewer things during the process), others force you to look at the makefile and modify things manually and can be more instructive. 

### WAYS OF PROGRAMMING (I'll copy my onenote notes here soon)
-- NOTE: so far I managed to compile C files. I still have to try do that in assembly.

- arduino IDE
- Atmel Studio, calling avrdude as external tool
- winavr
