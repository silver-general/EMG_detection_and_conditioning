# HARDWARE

### what I have:  
- instrumentation amplifier model: ...; characteristics: ...;  
the instrumentation amplifier takes 2 voltage inputs referred to ground and returns their difference, and greatly cuts (see CMRR) the common voltage. outputs a single voltage (the difference) amplified by a formula (you can change the gain by altering one external resistor).

- attiny85 microcontroller. can do a lot of things, but has limits in memory.

- atmega2560. arduino mega microcontroller. can do more stuff, but still has limits. it can be used to program the ATtiny!

# SOFTWARE

this is just for MCU programming, so anything could do.
- arduino ide 
- atmel studio
